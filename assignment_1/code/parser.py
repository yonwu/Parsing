# IMPLEMENT CKY

# NOTE: norm_words is a list of pairs (norm, word), where word is the word
#       occurring in the input sentence and norm is either the same word,
#       if it is a known word according to the grammar, or the string _RARE_.
#       Thus, norm should be used for grammar lookup but word should be used
#       in the output tree.

# Initialize your charts (for scores and backpointers)

# Code for adding the words to the cahrt

# Code for the dynamic programming part, where larger and larger subtrees are built

# Below is one option for retrieving the best trees, assuming we only want trees with the "S" category
# This is a simplification, since not all sentences are of the category "S"
# The exact arguments also depends on how you implement your back-pointer chart.
# Below it is also assumed that it is called "bp"
# return backtrace(bp[0, n, "S"], bp)
